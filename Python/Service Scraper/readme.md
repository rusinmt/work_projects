## EPU History Scraper

This ETL script automates data extraction and document retrieval from the Polish e-court system, e-sad.gov.pl, using Selenium. It begins by logging into the system and navigating to the user's deliveries page, where it sets a specified date range filter, in this case the last seven days. The script then extracts data for multiple options, downloading XLS files in the process. These files are transformed using pandas, combining data from multiple sources into a single DataFrame, including the extraction of reference numbers. The processed data is then saved as a CSV file with the current date in the filename, serving as a raw tier of data. Following this, the script uses the extracted data to navigate the website and download associated PDF documents, renaming and organizing them based on reference numbers and case details. Throughout the process, the script incorporates error handling and wait times to manage website latency and potential issues. It also provides visual feedback on the operation's status via the tqdm library. This automated ETL process significantly streamlines extracting court delivery data and retrieving associated documents in a single execution.
