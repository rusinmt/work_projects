## XML Court Order Parser and Data Extractor

I have developed a Python application that processes electronic court orders (EPU) stored in XML format, transforming complex hierarchical data into an organized tabular structure for clarity of the result. The application systematically parses XML files containing court orders, handling nested elements and multiple namespaces to extract critical information such as case signatures and identification codes. By leveraging the ElementTree library for XML parsing and Pandas for data manipulation, the solution efficiently processes multiple files in batch.
The solution also incorporates regular expression processing to standardize text formatting, particularly for court case signatures. The final output is exported to a CSV file with appropriate encoding for Eastern European character support (CP1250), making the data readily available for downstream analysis or import into other systems.
