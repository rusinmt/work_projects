This Python project automates the transfer of files from SFTP servers to a Synology Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, leveraging cron for scheduled execution. Configuration is managed through the SFTPConfig class, which encapsulates essential parameters such as SFTP user credentials, the time window for file selection (enabling incremental updates), and the destination path on the Synology NAS. This structured configuration approach facilitates managing multiple SFTP accounts with distinct settings.

The project employs two primary classes for core functionality. The SynologyUploader class handles interactions with the Synology NAS API, ensuring secure and reliable file uploads to the designated storage location. This separation of concerns promotes code maintainability and extensibility. The SFTPSync class manages SFTP connections, retrieves files based on their modification time, and orchestrates the transfer process. Context managers (__enter__ and __exit__ methods) within SFTPSync guarantee proper connection management, preventing resource leaks and ensuring clean execution.

File retrieval is optimized by using a configurable time window, transferring only recently modified files and minimizing bandwidth usage. The script recursively traverses the specified SFTP directory structure, identifying files within the defined time range. The retrieved files are then uploaded to the Synology NAS, preserving the original directory structure. The use of posixpath ensures cross-platform compatibility, allowing the script to run seamlessly on various operating systems. Comprehensive logging is implemented throughout the script, providing detailed information about the transfer process, including successful uploads, errors encountered, and connection status. This detailed logging is invaluable for monitoring the script's operation, troubleshooting issues, and auditing data transfers.

The sync_multiple_accounts function orchestrates the entire process, iterating through a dictionary of SFTP configurations and performing the synchronization for each account. This function also incorporates a basic internal scheduling mechanism, allowing for different synchronization frequencies per account via the schedule parameter ("skipt" for every run, "med" for execution only at specific times).
